#### Abstract: Various types of brain tumors occur in both children and adults. These tumors manifest with different characteristics such as malignancy, cellular lineage, originated location, and ge-nomic profiling. Recently, immunotherapy, which manipulates immune cells in the tumor micro-environment (TME) to kill tumor cells, has attracted attention as a treatment strategy for tumors. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomic architecture of the brain tumor microenvironment to pro-vide potential guidelines to overcome the therapeutic vulnerabilities for brain tumors. We decom-posed the cellular populations of six brain tumor types (meningioma, pilocytic astrocytoma, ep-endymoma, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, and lower-grade glioma) using publicly available microarray data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Interestingly, transcrip-tome-based immune-cell profiling revealed that infiltrating immune cell types in brain TME, par-ticularly M2 macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells, could be distinguished by tumor type, malignancy, and location. scRNA-seq revealed differences in the proportions of dendritic and mu-ral cells. Unsupervised clustering using immune-related genes divided all samples into two dis-tinct clusters with different characteristics. In addition, immune subpopulations showed disparate reactions after anti-PD-1 therapy for glioblastoma. Our results unveiled the distinct TME across brain tumor types and provided a transcriptomic landscape. Our findings may contribute to real-izing future precision medicine, providing the basic rationale for therapeutics of brain tumors.![image](https://github.com/jiin04018/BT_profiling/assets/89526030/f1c1647e-264d-4e42-9dda-061778f7a8dc)
